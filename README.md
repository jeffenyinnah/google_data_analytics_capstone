This notebook is part of capstone project to be completed for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In the final course of the Coursera program I was given a task to analyze a case with fictional bicycle renting company Cyclistic.

I had to analyze rides data collected through last 12 month in order to find differences between casual riders and annual subscribers.
